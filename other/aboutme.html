     <p>hi! I'm Josh, a dumb 13 year old who really wants to be a game developer... he's just not quite there yet. I'm American, and i'm... not proud of it? I live in Texas, the "biggest state in the US" *cough cough*... Jokes aside, thank you for visiting my website!! make sure to check out my games. </p>
