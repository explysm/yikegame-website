     <p>Hi! I'm explysm (Or yikegames), a dumb 13 year old who really wants to be a game developer... He's just not quite there yet. I'm American, and I'm... Not proud of it? I live in Texas, the "biggest state in the US" *cough cough*... Jokes aside, thank you for visiting my website!! Make sure to check out my games. </p>
